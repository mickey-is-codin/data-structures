# binary-trees

The two programs currently in the `binary-trees` project are:
 * rand-tree
 * ord-tree

The two programs accomplish similar goals, but were created with different goals in mind because of the nature of their formations.

The `rand-tree` program ...

The `ord-tree` program...

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
The only external commands that are run for this project are shipped with the `graphviz` package.

**Mac**
```
brew install graphviz
```

**Ubuntu/Debian**

The dot package for graphviz should come pre-installed on most ships of Debian, however if it's not there:
```
sudo apt-get install graphviz
```

### Installing
Clone this repository and navigate to the c-networks directory where you'll make the bin directory for executables
```
git clone https://github.com/smit2300/data-structures.git
cd data-structures/binary-trees
mkdir bin
```

Build
```
make all
```

And that's it! You should now have two executables, one for building a graph through the use of an adjacency matrix and the other using an adjacency list.
