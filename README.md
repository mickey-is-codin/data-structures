<h1>Data Structures</h1>

<p>
    Due to me really enjoying Purdue's ECE 368 Data Structures course,
    I thought I would continue my data structures learning. The goal of
    this project is to go back through any projects I thought of for
    previous data structures, as well as to learn new data structures.
    Rather than just full assignment implementation of the structures
    I would like to have some boilerplate and UNIX-style programs that
    I can use with the data structures in a more seamless way.
